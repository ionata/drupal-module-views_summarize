CONFIGURATION
-------------

This module does not itself have configuration, but each Views display you
create that uses the Summarized table display style does. Add and configure the
fields you want to display, then click the "settings" link for the Summarized
table format. On the popup form, in the table, will be the Summarize column that
allows you to specify which summary handler to use for that field.

Also on that form, toward the bottom of the form, is the "Display the summary
row only" setting. Checking that box means that the data that is being
summarized will not be displayed.
